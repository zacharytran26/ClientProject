To test:

1. download a zip file. there should be a green button called CODE. Click on the button and at the end of the dropdown, select download ZIP.

2. make sure that you can access this folder on your computer. I recommend putting this folder on your Desktop to access it easily.

3. On your CHROME browser, go to this link: chrome://extensions/. On the top right, there should be a toggle that should enable Developer mode. swipe on the developer mode.

4. There should be three buttons that should appear. Click on the one that says Load Unpacked. Select the folder that you downloaded on put on your Desktop.
